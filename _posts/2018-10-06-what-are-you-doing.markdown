Now, we are in holiday. We have many free time. So, what are you doing today? Are you looking for new hobies? On the otherhand, try to learn new technologies, scripts, projects etc. to make good things for yourself and for open-source world.

## Ask yourself something about {...} fîll in the blank
While people are doing something about projects, people should ask theirself “ What am i doing ”. I am trying to ask this question everyday to myself. Mostly, i can forget about that of course especially at the weekends. Nowadays, people would like to always produce something new. At least they are trying, learning, searching. We should not stay behind. We must consider that. I think open-source world best oppurtunity for this. If you produce something for it, you can take your feedbacks very quickly.

## Code in Job or Code in {...} fîll in the blank.

Holidays are our freedom days. Summer, sun , sand , sea and no more job for a while. Pay attention please this ; 
* If (WeAreIn=='Job')
* allyear[]= {computer screen,bugs,deadlines...} 
* If (WeAreIn=='holiday')
* forholiday[]= {sun,sea,social-time,peace,games,beach,abroad.,.,..}

Consider all of these, who wants write some code in holidays. Usually, if you check github projects; there are too many project which are commit in holiday times, in the night or at the weekends. During the week, just commits for their job, not anything else. Actually, I want to tell this; 
> **If we dont care about our free times, we cant learn different things.Especially in open-source world.**

Have a good day !
