Today , i would like to talk about my history of programming. In 2013 , I was an professional Counter Strike player in a professional team. I was spending my all time in computer while playing game. Our team started to separate and every team player went to another way. So , i am done with the game. I need a something in computer. My old team mate told me some hacker things. He was doing very attractive things. One day , he started to teach me a few thing in computer. This is where the my story of programming begins.

>Try to be hacker !

Software world is not attractive place at the first. On the contrary , there are a few thing which they are very 'fancy' like hack your best friend or your ex-girlfriend. I know , many people start with coding to try hack something or try use some software tools for doing something. I start with some tools. They can scan all the site for the admin login page. Most attractive event is that you always search something and open too much browser tabs. The time which you lost in these tabs , you completed  the first part of becoming coder. 

>Building some website ! 

At this point , everything start with trying to create a website for your relatives. I was trying everyday to just a create simple introduction page some children tools. No marketing , no fancy pages. Only purpose of this having a working web-site. Of course , i didnt get any paid. I was doing for charity , you know. My idea was just a evolve myself like every developer.

### My only remorse !

In high-school years , we were racing like a race-horses. We had purposes ;
- going to good university
- making good point from university exam
- make your family proud etc.

These are kind of a few examples. People have different goals. Actually , we spent our time with solving too much exams. I forgot the software , coding , my computer. You know codes are ungrateful. I wish, I had not stop coding. Anyway , we are here now. I know there are a lots of people like me. 

* Have a good day !
