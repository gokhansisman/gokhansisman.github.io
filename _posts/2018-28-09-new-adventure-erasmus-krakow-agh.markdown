Hello from Krakow, Poland. Today, I found some time for writing. I came here on 25th September.

## Starting with paper works ! 

If you are planning to do the Erasmus program, you need to prepare yourself against documents. After all the paperwork is done, the fun begins. Are you ready for the most unforgettable moments of your life?

>First impression for erasmus; Where am I really ?!

Krakow is a very convenient city for Erasmus because many students come from all over the world. I am happy to have been here. AGH University is quite big and full of opportunities. They have nice and comfortable areas, new buildings and good education.

>I dont wanna lose my habit of coding!

Everything is okay for sure. However, there are a lot of events every day. I can't find time for regular things, really. That's why I am afraid of losing my coding skills. I will plan for my all days. I need a kind of plan because of events, parties, etc. I should find free time for coding, courses and also can find time for events. Both are important to me. I can find a balance, I hope.

*To be continued...(I will write all experiences here!)

>After 2 years

Hello again, I haven't written for a long time. During my Erasmus, I was really busy with courses and traveling. I can say that I gained a lot of experience in general and specific topics. On the other hand, I want to talk about learning English. I think that I was enough to speak English and follow academic publications. Unfortunately, this is not true and I saw that during my Erasmus time. Luckily, I've had a lot of time and opportunity to practice.

### Here are my all courses and projects from (Erasmus) semester.
* Advanced C++ Programming 
* Computer Graphics(ThreeJS)
* Deep Learning(Python, Neural Network, Jupyter)
* Software Engineering(Project with AGILE)
* Signals are Systems
