If you need any sign from officals , you have to just wait for them. So , all adventure start with papers and will be finish with papers too !

>" First impression for erasmus ; Where am I really ?! "

Krakow is a very good city for erasmus because many students come from all over the world(I mean different nations). I am very glad to came here. On the other side , AGH University is really big and full of opportunities. They have nice and comfort areas , new buildings and good education. We'll see that of course.

>" I dont wanna lose my habit of coding !"

Everything is okay for sure. However , there are a lots of events in everyday. I cant find time for regular things , really. Thats why , I am afraid of losing my coding skills. I will plan for my all days. I need kind of plan because of events, parties etc. I should find a free time for coding , courses and also can find time for events. Both are important for me. I can find a balance , i hope.

*To be continued...(I will write all experiences here!)

> " After 2 years " 

Hello again, I haven't written for a long time. During my erasmus, I was really busy with courses and travelling. I can say that I gained a lot of experience in general and specific topics. First of all, I want to say about learning english. I was thinking, I was good enough to speak English and follow academic publications. In fact, It wasnt like that and I learned that via hard way during my erasmus time. 

### Here my all courses and projects from (Erasmus) semester.
* Advanced C++ Programming 
* Computer Graphics(ThreeJS)
* Deep Learning(Python,Neural Network,Jupyter)
* Software Engineering(Project with AGILE)
* Signals are Systems
