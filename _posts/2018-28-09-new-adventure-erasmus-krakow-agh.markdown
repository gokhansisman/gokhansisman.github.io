Hello from Krakow , Poland. Today , i found a free time for writing to my blog. I came here in 25th September.

## Starting with paper works ! 
If you are planning to doing erasmus program , first you need to know that paper works does not end. You should all time in a rush. Time will start to pass very fast durin all program. If you need any sign from officals , you have to just wait for them. So , all adventure start with papers and will be finish with papers too !

>" First impression for erasmus ; Where am I really ?! "

Krakow is a very good city for erasmus because many students come from all over the world(I mean different nations). I am very glad to came here. On the other side , AGH Univercity is really big and full of opportunities. They have nice and comfort areas , new buildings and good education. We'll see that of course.

>" I dont wanna lose my habit of coding !"

Everything is okay for sure. However , there are a lots of events in everyday. I cant find time for regular things , really. Thats why , I am afraid of losing my coding skills. I will plan for my all days. I need kind of plan because of events, parties etc. I should find a free time for coding , courses and also can find time for events. Both are important for me. I can find a balance , i hope.

*To be continued...(I will write all experiences here!)
