Hello from Krakow , Poland. Today , i found a free time for writing to my blog. I came here in 25th September.

## Ask yourself something about {...} fîll in the blank
While people are doing something about projects , people should ask theirself " What am i doing ". I am trying to ask myself all the time this question. Sometimes , i can forget especially at the weekends. Nowadays, people always produce something new. At least they are trying , learning , searching. We should not stay behind. We must consider that.I think open-source world best oppurtunity for this. If you produce something for it , you can take your responses very quickly.

>Code in Job or Code in {...} fîll in the blank.

Holidays are our freedom days. Summer, sun , sand , sea and no more job for a while. Pay attention please this ; 
* If (WeAreIn=='Job')
* allyear[]= {computer screen,bugs,deadlines...} 
* If (WeAreIn=='holiday')
* forholiday[]= {sun,sea,social-time,peace,games,beach,abroad.,.,..}

Consider all of these , who wants write some code in holidays. Usually , if you check github projects ; there are too many project which are commit in holiday times, in the night or at the weekends. During the week , just commits for their job , not anything else. Actually , I want to tell this ; 
>If we dont consider our free times correctly , we cant learn different things.Especially in open-source world.

Have a good day !
