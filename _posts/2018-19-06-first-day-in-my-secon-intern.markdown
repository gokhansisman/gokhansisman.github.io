Hello everyone, today is my first day as a second intern. Students(like me) know that kind of emotion. On the first day, you smell the atmosphere with a silent mood since from the morning and waiting for your team leader or someone who has free time.

### Fresh Start!

Like many developers, you should probably hear ReactJS. Today is a good day to learn new library which is extremely popular nowadays.
 Let’s look at the starting key topics; DOM(Document Object Model), VirtualDOM, and HTML tags js codes.

### What is DOM ? 

Basically, objects of everything include HTML. We can create an object which has all code from Html. The name “Document Object Model” was chosen because it is an “object model” is used in the traditional object-oriented design sense: documents are modeled using objects, and the model encompasses not only the structure of a document but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed.

### What is VirtualDOM ?

Firstly, Virtual DOM was not invented by React, but React uses it and provides for the open-source world free of charge.

The Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the HTML DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the browser-specific implementation details. Since the DOM itself was already an abstraction, the virtual DOM is, in fact, an abstraction of an abstraction. You can think of the virtual DOM as a blueprint.

### End of the Day!

Reading a lot of documents on the internet is a really tiring job. But if you like to research especially recursively :) Probably, I‘ll keep going to learn React.js and trying to develop my JS knowledge.

Have a good day!
