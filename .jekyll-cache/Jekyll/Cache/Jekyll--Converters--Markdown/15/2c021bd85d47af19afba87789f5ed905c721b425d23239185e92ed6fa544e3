I"¹<p>Hello everyone , today i would like to talk about a few tips which they are my favorite stuffs. At the beginning of writing code , you can learn basic developer skills. Generally , they are include syntax rules and scope things. Letâ€™s start with first tip also it is very common.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading Open-source Project !</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Developers need to be dynamic and follow the modern code or software understanding. Reading different projects , stranger codes or something is really unusual for you. A developer should have good view of open-source perspective. It will takes a long time but in the end you gonna reach something very beneficial!</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn and Use Design Patterns !</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>A good developer should learn design principles and he/she must use design patterns in your project. The main key is writing code in a good shape. When other developers looked your codes , they should easily understand your code. Design patterns can help you in this issue. They make your code understandable and global. Developers try to create a common way for understand codes how to work. So , people need to understand these design patterns!</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing Unit Test !</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The new important skill is writing unit test. If you look job advertisements , you can see this feature more often. Actually , complete a code is not enough in new world. You need to complete with all your debugs. Its very important for a specific high level. I am trying to learn how to write unit test for my codes. You should learn too!</p>
